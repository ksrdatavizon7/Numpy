# 🧮 NumPy For Everyone
## 🧠 100 NumPy Examples – KSR Datavizon
Welcome to the 100 NumPy Examples series by KSR Datavizon – a practical, hands-on collection of real-world NumPy use cases ranging from array creation and indexing to broadcasting, statistics, and performance tricks.

# 📁 Contents
## 📝 Section 1 – NumPy Basics to Intermediate
This section builds a strong foundation in NumPy:
✅ Creating arrays (1D, 2D, 3D)
✅ Inspecting array shape, type, size
✅ Indexing, slicing, reshaping
✅ Broadcasting and vectorized operations
✅ Aggregations and axis-based functions
✅ Basic arithmetic and logical operations

Great for beginners looking to replace loops with fast NumPy operations.

## ⚙️ Section 2 – Advanced NumPy Techniques
This section dives deeper into:
🔁 Stacking, splitting, and tiling arrays
🧩 Masking, filtering, and conditional logic
📈 Statistical functions (mean, std, percentile)
📐 Matrix multiplication, dot product, transpose
🧠 Random number generation and sampling
⚡ Performance tips using np.where, np.argsort, np.unique, etc.
